# ChatBot
• Implemented a medibot that can communicate with users about health issues like the existence and treatment of various diseases
• Preprocessed the corpus containing details of diseases, converted the sentences to vectors. Used bag of words for vectorizing the text
• The vectors were scaled using TF-IDF values, cosine similarity is used to find the sentence vector that is most similar to the query vector
